# 🏡 House Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting house prices using multiple machine learning techniques. It involves regression models, classification algorithms, dimensionality reduction, and evaluation strategies to determine the most effective approach for house price prediction.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `7ef4e114-c214-40d1-a8c0-7b05a9c89849.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model implementation, visualizations, and analysis.
- `README.md`: Documentation for understanding and running the project.

## 📌 Techniques Used

- ✅ Simple Linear Regression  
- ✅ Multiple Linear Regression  
- ✅ Polynomial Regression  
- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification  
- ✅ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- ✅ Cross-Validation (K-Fold)  
- ✅ Data Visualization (Heatmaps, Pairplots, etc.)

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand how different housing features impact the final price.
- Compare the performance of linear, polynomial, and KNN models.
- Use PCA for dimensionality reduction to improve performance.
- Apply K-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- Visualize and interpret data insights.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various housing attributes such as:
- Area (square feet)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location indicators
- Final sale price
